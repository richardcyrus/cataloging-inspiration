# Cataloging Inspiration -- Team Charlotte

Create a community site to record the things that spark your imagination and to share and bounce ideas with others.

The concept is born from the idea of a scrapbook where you are able to add and tag images, caption them, add tutorials on processes you're working with, and add instructions or though processes for the related items.

## Other ideas on the concept

- a tutorial discussion board
- an interactive place where you can converse with others
- on-line workshops and challenges.
- digital sketchbook
- user rated article and favorites
